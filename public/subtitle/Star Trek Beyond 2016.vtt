1
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.605
My name is
Captain James Tiberius Kirk

2
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.887
of the United Federation of Planets.

3
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.442
I am appearing before you
as a neutral representative

4
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.204
of the Fibonan Republic.

5
00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.847
I bring you a message of goodwill

6
00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.043
and present to you esteemed members
of the Teenaxi Delegation,

7
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.049
a gift from the Fibonan High Council
with the highest regard.

8
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.724
What's wrong with it?

9
00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.040
Uh, excuse me?

10
00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.362
Why don't they want it anymore?

11
00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.603
Uh, well, this was once
a piece of an ancient weapon,

12
00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.688
and now they offer it as a symbol of...

13
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.640
Of peace.

14
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.325
In the Fibonan culture,

15
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.721
to surrender a weapon
is an offer of truce.

16
00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.165
How did they come by it?

17
00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.686
They told me
they acquired it a long time ago.

18
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.205
So they stole it, then.

19
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.282
No, they, um... Well, I don't know.

20
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.931
You don't know the Fibonans like we do!

21
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.401
Yeah, that's very true.
Your Excellency, this gift...

22
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.086
They're a crowd of untrustworthy thieves

23
00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.639
who want to see us murdered
in our own beds!

24
00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.971
This beloved artifact
is a symbol of trust and peace.

25
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.329
They want to chop us into pieces
and roast us over a fire!

26
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.730
No, no... I don't think that's true.

27
00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.764
And eat us!

28
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.121
What?

29
00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.926
Scotty! Get me out of here!

30
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.729
- That was quick.
- Scotty!

31
00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.960
There's quite a bit
of surface interference, sir.

32
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.170
Scotty!

33
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.281
Get it off of me!

34
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.328
I ripped my shirt again.

35
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.639
How'd it go?

36
00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.971
Captain, did you manage
to broker a treaty with the Teenaxi?

37
00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.326
Uh... Let's just say I came up short.

38
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.927
Will you, uh, log that and put it
in the vault, Spock? Thank you.

39
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.683
Jim, you look like crap.

40
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.001
Thank you, Bones.

41
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.930
You got that little vein popping out
of your temple again. You okay?

42
00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.610
Never better!
Just another day in the fleet.

43
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.205
Captain's Log, Stardate 2263.2.

44
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.603
Today is our 966th day in deep space,

45
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.842
a little under three years
into our five-year mission.

46
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.324
The more time we spend out here,

47
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.249
the harder it is to tell
where one day ends

48
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.884
and the next one begins.

49
00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:30.047
It can be a challenge to feel grounded
when even gravity is artificial.

50
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.122
But, well, we do what we can
to make it feel like home.

51
00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:40.125
The crew, as always,
continues to act admirably

52
00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.841
despite the rigors of our extended stay
here in outer space.

53
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.923
And the personal sacrifices
they have made.

54
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.245
We continue to search
for new life forms

55
00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.483
in order to establish firm diplomatic ties.

56
00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:56.930
Our extended time in uncharted territory

57
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.286
has stretched the ship's
mechanical capacities.

58
00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.687
But fortunately
our engineering department,

59
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.843
led by Mr. Scott,
is more than up to the job.

60
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.800
The ship aside,
prolonged cohabitation has

61
00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.247
definitely had effects
on interpersonal dynamics.

62
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.560
Some experiences for the better,

63
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.846
and some for the worse.

64
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.807
As for me, things have started to feel
a little episodic.

65
00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.250
The farther out we go,
the more I find myself wondering

66
00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.447
what it is we're trying to accomplish.

67
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.764
If the universe is truly endless,

68
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.090
then are we not striving
for something forever out of reach?

69
00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.687
The Enterprise is scheduled
for a reprovisioning stop at Yorktown,

70
00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.923
the Federation's newest
and most advanced starbase.

71
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.367
Perhaps a break from routine
will offer up some respite

72
00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.125
from the mysteries of the unknown.

73
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:15.370
Sorry I'm late.

74
00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.569
Keenser's leaking
some kind of highly acidic green goo,

75
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.120
and Scotty's terrified
he's gonna sneeze on the warp core

76
00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.360
and kill us all.

77
00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:24.723
What the hell are you drinking?

78
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.571
Uh, I'm pretty sure
it's the rest of that Saurian brandy

79
00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.800
we picked up on Thasus.

80
00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.362
My God, man, are you trying to go blind?

81
00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.644
That stuff's illegal.

82
00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.007
Besides, I found this in Chekov's locker.

83
00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:40.606
- Wow.
- Right?

84
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.170
I mean, I always assumed he'd be

85
00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:44.009
- a vodka man.
- A vodka guy, exactly.

86
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.125
I wanted to have
something appropriate for your birthday.

87
00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.363
Uh, that's in a couple days.
You know I don't care about that.

88
00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:53.091
I know. I know you don't like
celebrating it on the day

89
00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:55.685
because it's also the day
your pa bit the dust.

90
00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.807
I was being sensitive.

91
00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.810
Did they teach you about
bedside manner in medical school?

92
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.682
It's just your southern charm.

93
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.803
- Oh, yeah. That's good.
- Ooh.

94
00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:16.880
Lordy!

95
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.528
Are you gonna call your mom?

96
00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:24.081
Yeah, of course. I'll call her on the day.

97
00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:29.009
I'm one year older.

98
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.766
Yep, that's usually how it works.

99
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.480
A year older than he ever got to be.

100
00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.406
He joined Starfleet because he...

101
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.204
He believed in it.

102
00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.641
I joined on a dare.

103
00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:51.167
You joined to see
if you could live up to him.

104
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.566
Uh, you spent all this time
trying to be George Kirk

105
00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.923
and now you're wondering
just what it means to be Jim.

106
00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:02.084
Why you're out here.

107
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.526
To perfect eyesight
and a full head of hair.

108
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.326
Kirk here.

109
00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:17.242
Captain,
approaching Yorktown base.

110
00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:19.209
I'm on my way, Mr. Sulu.

111
00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:23.524
Let's keep this birthday thing
under wraps, huh?

112
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.250
Yeah, you know me. Mr. Sensitive.

113
00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:33.209
Wow. That is impressive.

114
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.841
Aye, she's a beauty, isn't she?

115
00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:37.929
What a damn monstrosity!

116
00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:40.448
Couldn't we just rent
some space on a planet?

117
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.962
Showing geographical favoritism
among inducted Federation worlds

118
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.525
could cause diplomatic tension.

119
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.965
Oh, you don't think that looks tense?

120
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.203
Looks like a damn snow globe
in space just waiting to break!

121
00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:53.602
Oh, that's the spirit, Bones.

122
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.051
Spock!

123
00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.370
Do you have a moment?

124
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.167
Of course, Nyota.

125
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.645
I think you should have this back.

126
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.005
After all, it belonged to your mother.

127
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.647
It's not in the Vulcan custom

128
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.769
to receive again
that which was given as a gift.

129
00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480
You guys break up?

130
00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:48.561
What'd you do?

131
00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:51.721
A typically reductive inquiry, Doctor.

132
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.086
You know, Spock, if an Earth girl says,
uh, "It's me, not you,"

133
00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:00.004
it's definitely you.

134
00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:07.208
Excuse me. Commander Spock?

135
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.163
May we have a moment of your time?

136
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.602
This is wonderful!
You know I've never been here?

137
00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:17.604
What I hear is that
the bars here are excellent.

138
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.606
I'm so glad you guys could come.

139
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.807
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

140
00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:39.963
Live long and prosper.

141
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.481
Live long and prosper.

142
00:12:47.879 --> 00:12:50.120
IFF alert on incoming vessel.

143
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.761
Unidentified. Non-Federation.

144
00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:56.288
Attention, unidentified vessel.
You are not authorized for approach.

145
00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.283
Power down and await instructions.

146
00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:03.442
Unidentified vessel, please comply.

147
00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:18.049
Speak normally.

148
00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:25.409
Language analysis complete.

149
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.970
Is this working?

150
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.962
We were on a science mission
inside the nebula.

151
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:36.563
Our ship suffered a critical malfunction.

152
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.480
I took an escape pod

153
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.165
before the ship crash landed
on a nearby planet.

154
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.846
We need a ship
capable of navigating the nebula.

155
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.443
You must have someone

156
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.485
who can help us.

157
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.605
We tracked her stranded ship
to a sector of uncharted nebula,

158
00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:05.683
here at 2-1-0 mark 14.

159
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.605
- Uh, long-range scan?
- No data.

160
00:14:10.039 --> 00:14:12.725
The nebula is too dense.
It's uncharted space.

161
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.525
Well, the Enterprise does have
the best navigational system in the fleet.

162
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.600
She could handle it.

163
00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:21.125
The only ship here
with more advanced technology

164
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.408
is still under construction.

165
00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:26.527
But it's not just the
ship that I'm sending.

166
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.567
- I'll gather the crew.
- Captain.

167
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.764
Starfleet command
sent me your application

168
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.764
for the Vice Admiral position
here at this installation.

169
00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:39.850
Yes, ma'am. Um...

170
00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:43.725
If I may, I would

171
00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:48.086
recommend Commander Spock
replace me as Captain of the Enterprise.

172
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.725
He is an exemplary Starfleet officer.
He'd make a great captain.

173
00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.721
It isn't uncommon, you know,

174
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.684
even for a captain,

175
00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:01.082
to want to leave.

176
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.004
There is no relative direction
in the vastness of space.

177
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.322
There is only yourself,

178
00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:11.484
your ship, your crew.

179
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.086
It's easier than you think, to get lost.

180
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.961
- It's not about...
- I'll bring it up with the General Council.

181
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.764
We'll discuss it when you return.

182
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.407
Ma'am.

183
00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:35.000
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

184
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.565
- I was thinking...
- Perhaps there...

185
00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:41.207
- No, please.
- Captain, after you.

186
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.647
I insist.

187
00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:47.211
After this mission,
we should, uh, sit down.

188
00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:49.129
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

189
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.928
I as well have something to share.

190
00:15:57.559 --> 00:15:59.403
We make a good team. Right?

191
00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:02.765
I believe we do.

192
00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:08.400
I insist.

193
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.567
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a ship-wide channel.

194
00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:32.004
Yes, Captain.

195
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.565
Attention, crew of the Enterprise.

196
00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:40.211
Our mission is straightforward.

197
00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:44.764
Rescue a crew stranded on a planet
in uncharted space.

198
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.770
Our trajectory will take us
through an unstable nebula,

199
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.841
one which will disable
all communications with Starfleet.

200
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.600
We're gonna be on our own.

201
00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:58.480
The Enterprise has something
no other ship in the fleet has,

202
00:16:58.799 --> 00:16:59.801
you.

203
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.370
And as we've come to understand,

204
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.965
there is no such thing as the unknown,

205
00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:08.089
only the temporarily hidden.

206
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.441
Kirk out.

207
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:33.361
Mmm. Readings indicate
cloud density diminishing, sir.

208
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.205
This is Altamid.
My ship is stranded here.

209
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.320
Approaching Altamid. Class-M planet.

210
00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:09.490
Massive subterranean development.

211
00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:11.528
But limited to no life forms
on the surface.

212
00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:13.121
Proximity alert, sir!

213
00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:15.124
We have an unknown ship
heading right for us.

214
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.845
- Lieutenant Uhura, hail them.
- Yes, Captain.

215
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:26.648
No response.
I am picking up some kind of signal.

216
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.970
They're jamming us.

217
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.124
Magnify, Mr. Sulu.

218
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.805
What is this?

219
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.365
Shields up! Red alert!

220
00:18:53.079 --> 00:18:54.490
Fire at will.

221
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.240
Sir, our phasers
are having minimal effect

222
00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:06.481
and our torpedos
can't track their movements!

223
00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:07.891
Fire everything we've got.

224
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.082
Captain, we are not equipped
for this manner of engagement.

225
00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:23.359
Shield frequencies have no effect, sir!

226
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.329
They took out the dish!
Shields are inoperable!

227
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.048
- Warp us out of here, Mr. Sulu.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:19:38.319 --> 00:19:39.445
Why the hell aren't we moving?

229
00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:41.442
I can't engage the warp drive, sir!

230
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.606
Scotty, I need warp now!

231
00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:51.567
I cannae, sir! The nacelles, they've...

232
00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:01.121
They've gone!

233
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.163
Security, engage
all emergency procedures.

234
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.288
Active protocol 28 Code One Alpha Zero.

235
00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:09.364
All personnel to alert stations.

236
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.005
Sir, I have hull breaches
in levels 12 to 15,

237
00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:39.084
6, 9, 31 and 21, sir.

238
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.606
Captain! There's a chance
I can reroute the energy reserves

239
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.330
from the warp core
to the impulse engines.

240
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.481
If we can get back into the nebula,
maybe we could lose them.

241
00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:48.410
Do whatever you have to, Scotty.

242
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.481
Wee man! Let's go.

243
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.926
Fit the plasma conduits
and stand by to reroute on my mark!

244
00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:28.201
- Captain.
- Go, Spock.

245
00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:29.519
I have identified the individual

246
00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.328
who appears to be
leading the attack party.

247
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240
He infiltrated the archive vault

248
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.681
and removed the artifact
from our mission on Teenax.

249
00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:37.250
Hold your distance until...

250
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.961
Spock!

251
00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:40.320
Spock!

252
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.891
You two, with me.
Sulu, you have the conn.

253
00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.961
Yes, sir.

254
00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:08.484
My God.

255
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.961
What the hell?

256
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.881
Doctor?

257
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.651
Doctor, we must evacuate now!

258
00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.690
Captain

259
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.050
Kirk.

260
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.768
Yes! We are at 100% impulse.

261
00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:25.250
Great work, Mr. Scott!

262
00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:27.084
Maximum impulse towards the nebula.

263
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.480
Aye.

264
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.800
Kirk to Bridge.

265
00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:02.086
We are losing
the inertial dampeners!

266
00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:04.089
Systems are failing ship-wide, Captain.

267
00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:06.244
Emergency bulkheads are sealing,

268
00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:09.801
but structural integrity
is at 18% and falling, sir!

269
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.688
Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu.

270
00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:16.410
Sound the alarm.

271
00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:21.961
Abandon ship. All personnel.

272
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.844
We need to give those pods
a chance to escape.

273
00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.684
Can you lead those ships away?

274
00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:28.286
Impulse engines are still trying
to draw power from the warp reserve.

275
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.969
We cannot move
until the saucer is separated.

276
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.361
I'll handle it.

277
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.086
Aye-aye, sir.

278
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.690
Abandon ship.
All personnel evacuate immediately.

279
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.007
You okay? Oh, my God.
Get him up. Help him up.

280
00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.161
Got you.

281
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.083
We've got to get you guys
to an escape pod. Go.

282
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.560
Go! Ensign Syl.

283
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.125
I need your help.

284
00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.526
Yes, sir.

285
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.204
My God.

286
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.481
Spock, they're taking the crew!

287
00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:39.287
Abandon ship.
All personnel evacuate immediately.

288
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.441
Are you okay?

289
00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:11.567
The saucer should be free by now!

290
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.246
I know, Mr. Sulu.
The Captain should be there!

291
00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:24.564
All personnel evacuate immediately.

292
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.484
Impulse engines drawing power
from auxiliary generators.

293
00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.925
Captain!

294
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.201
How many of the crew
are still aboard the saucer?

295
00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:28.480
None.

296
00:30:28.839 --> 00:30:30.887
But if I'm reading this correctly,

297
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.450
the intruders are taking them.

298
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.161
Captain,
we are caught in the planet's gravity.

299
00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:37.602
We cannot pull away.

300
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.090
Get to your Kelvin Pods.

301
00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:46.364
- Yes, sir.
- Aye, Captain.

302
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.009
Come on, let's go!

303
00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.201
Let's go.

304
00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:01.280
Come on.

305
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.161
Chekov!

306
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.163
You knew. You knew we'd be attacked.

307
00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:30.644
You don't understand.

308
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.246
Captain! Captain Kirk!

309
00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:41.527
Yes. I lied.

310
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.290
Our ship was attacked.

311
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.287
Chekov, check the comms for survivors.

312
00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:50.770
- Aye, Captain.
- Who is he?

313
00:33:51.839 --> 00:33:53.410
His name is Krall.

314
00:33:54.519 --> 00:33:57.364
He took my crew. Like he took yours.

315
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.048
How did he know so much
about the Enterprise?

316
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.804
All I know is that if I did this,

317
00:34:06.039 --> 00:34:07.565
he would set them free.

318
00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.530
Chekov, are you picking
anything up on those scanners?

319
00:34:11.559 --> 00:34:13.050
Nothing, sir.

320
00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.960
- What if they...
- No, no.

321
00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.800
He was taking them.

322
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.690
We have to find that saucer.

323
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.081
Even minimal scanning systems
will have more range than a tricorder.

324
00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:25.570
Aye, Captain, it's possible.

325
00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.210
Captain.

326
00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:31.007
I was protecting my crew.

327
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.280
What is your name?

328
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.369
How do you know our language?

329
00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:39.887
I know your kind.

330
00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:44.610
I am Lieutenant Nyota Uhura
of the U. S. S. Enterprise.

331
00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:46.920
And you have committed
an act of war against the...

332
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.485
Federation!

333
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.969
Federation is an act of war.

334
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.925
You attacked us.

335
00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.880
Your captain...

336
00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:07.407
Why did you sacrifice yourself for him?

337
00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:09.724
He would have done the same.

338
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.568
And if he made it off of that ship,
he will come for us.

339
00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:19.648
I am counting on it, Lieutenant Uhura.

340
00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.443
I can't believe it.

341
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.360
My God, Spock.

342
00:37:04.519 --> 00:37:05.521
God...

343
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.884
Sit down over here.

344
00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.329
Okay. Okay, sit. Easy.

345
00:37:15.039 --> 00:37:16.166
Okay.

346
00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:18.719
Now, just try and relax.
You're gonna be okay.

347
00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:21.048
The forced optimism
in your voice suggests

348
00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:23.282
that you are trying
to elicit a sense of calm in order to...

349
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360
I'll cut the horseshit.

350
00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:26.840
Doctor, I fail to see
how excrement of any kind

351
00:37:27.159 --> 00:37:29.527
bears relevance on our current situation.

352
00:37:29.679 --> 00:37:30.726
Whoa, whoa,
what the hell are you doing?

353
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.925
We must keep moving, Doctor.

354
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.842
Spock, this thing's punctured
your iliac region!

355
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.920
Time is a critical factor.

356
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.331
That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you.

357
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.768
Look, if I can't take this out,
you're gonna die.

358
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.365
Okay? If I take it out and can't stop
the bleeding, you're gonna die.

359
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.849
I can see no appeal in either option.

360
00:37:44.239 --> 00:37:45.764
Believe it or not, neither can I.

361
00:37:47.719 --> 00:37:50.768
So, if I remember correctly,

362
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.240
the Vulcans have their hearts
where humans have their livers.

363
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.003
That is correct, Doctor.

364
00:37:58.519 --> 00:38:00.409
That explains a thing or two.

365
00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.610
You know, you're lucky.
An inch to the left...

366
00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:10.362
And you'd be dead already.

367
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.329
I just don't get it, Spock.

368
00:38:13.639 --> 00:38:15.927
I mean, what did they attack us for?

369
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.324
I mean, they do all this for some

370
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.568
doodad that the tiny critters didn't want?

371
00:38:21.719 --> 00:38:23.050
It is unwise to trivialize

372
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.880
that which one
simply does not understand, Doctor.

373
00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:28.565
We can safely assume
it is more important than a doodad.

374
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.724
I think you just managed
to insult me twice, Spock.

375
00:38:39.519 --> 00:38:40.521
Okay.

376
00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:43.447
All right, Spock, I just got one question.

377
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.847
- What's your favorite color?
- I fail to see the relevance.

378
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.284
Ow!

379
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.090
Yeah. They say it hurts less
if it's a surprise.

380
00:38:56.239 --> 00:38:58.527
If I may adopt a parlance
with which you are familiar,

381
00:38:58.599 --> 00:39:01.922
I can confirm your theory
to be horseshit.

382
00:39:05.519 --> 00:39:07.284
We got to get out of here.

383
00:39:08.599 --> 00:39:09.601
Come on.

384
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.724
You're kidding me, aren't you?

385
00:39:45.239 --> 00:39:46.480
Hello there.

386
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.048
My name is Montgomery Scott.
And, uh, who might you be?

387
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.920
Watch it, sonny.

388
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.889
I'm pretty handy
when I want to be, all right?

389
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.202
Don't come back!

390
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.762
We certainly showed them, eh, lassie?

391
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.166
That's Starfleet property, okay.
You cannae just take it.

392
00:40:49.639 --> 00:40:51.847
Uh, but I'm feeling generous today,
so have at it.

393
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.043
Where you get that?

394
00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:56.690
- Is that English?
- I learn it from my house.

395
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.967
- Where you get that?
- It's my Starfleet insignia.

396
00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.280
What does it mean?

397
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.284
Means that I'm an officer of Starfleet.
Uh, engineering division.

398
00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:07.208
- Engineering?
- That's right. I fix things.

399
00:41:07.719 --> 00:41:08.721
I know what is engineering.

400
00:41:11.199 --> 00:41:13.440
You're not with those bastards
that killed my ship, are you?

401
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.929
I'll take that as a no.

402
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.525
He is Krall. Him and his

403
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.360
bees.

404
00:41:24.119 --> 00:41:26.088
They search the stars
for a death machine.

405
00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:29.481
They're the reason why you here.
Why we are all here.

406
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.251
Even those three scunners?

407
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.684
They have fallen from the sky,
like me and you.

408
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.927
Come with me. Now!

409
00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.164
Wait, no... Hang on a minute, lassie.
I'm having a difficult day here.

410
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.284
I've got to find my crewmates.

411
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.961
I will help you find your mates.

412
00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:50.768
And then you will help me.

413
00:41:51.559 --> 00:41:52.561
With what?

414
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.599
You want me to fix something?

415
00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:58.286
Yes. You help me, and I help you.

416
00:41:59.559 --> 00:42:01.130
All right, well, things being as they are,

417
00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:03.679
I doubt I'll get a better offer today,
so, lead the way.

418
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.081
Good.

419
00:42:05.159 --> 00:42:06.764
I am Jaylah.

420
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.286
- And you are Montgomery Scott.
- Aye, Scotty.

421
00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:12.443
Come now, Montgomery Scotty.

422
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.121
All right, hold up.

423
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.728
The Enterprise.

424
00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:39.724
She may not even have power
to the Bridge, Captain.

425
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.365
She still has a few tricks up her sleeve.

426
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.851
I'd bet on it.

427
00:42:51.719 --> 00:42:53.369
McCoy to Enterprise. Come in.

428
00:42:54.039 --> 00:42:55.882
McCoy to Enterprise.

429
00:42:58.599 --> 00:42:59.885
Hey, take it easy there, Spock.

430
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.849
That was just
a temporary fix back there.

431
00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.126
I understand, Doctor.

432
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.206
Fascinating.

433
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.601
Ominous. Dark. Dangerous.

434
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.126
We're going in.

435
00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.010
Intriguing.
These symbols are the same as those

436
00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.327
depicted on the artifact
taken in the attack.

437
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.322
You think it came from here?

438
00:43:47.199 --> 00:43:48.884
It would seem so.

439
00:43:53.199 --> 00:43:54.360
Damn it, Spock.

440
00:43:56.119 --> 00:43:57.644
Easy. Easy.

441
00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.204
Hurry.

442
00:44:06.239 --> 00:44:08.811
- Are we there yet?
- Stop asking that.

443
00:44:09.159 --> 00:44:11.561
- Sorry.
- This is the way. Come.

444
00:44:12.599 --> 00:44:15.728
And watch your steps.
You do not want to set off my traps.

445
00:44:17.519 --> 00:44:18.601
Oh.

446
00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:20.125
That's clever.

447
00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.449
What is this place?

448
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.963
- This is my house.
- Your house?

449
00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:28.646
Hold on a minute. Is this a ship?

450
00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.442
I help you find your friends
and you help me fix it.

451
00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:34.722
So I can leave this planet forever.

452
00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:38.967
Wait a minute. Is this your ship?

453
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.003
No, Montgomery Scotty.

454
00:44:42.639 --> 00:44:43.971
It's yours.

455
00:44:45.239 --> 00:44:46.730
Oh, my good Lord.

456
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.320
Captain,
it looks like there is power.

457
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.365
All right,
let's get to the Bridge and find the crew.

458
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.489
The console is intact, Captain.

459
00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:46.369
I will try to reroute power to it.

460
00:45:47.199 --> 00:45:48.201
Work fast.

461
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.766
Once we get this place lit up,
we're gonna draw a lot of attention.

462
00:45:52.719 --> 00:45:54.244
What do you think,
can you find them?

463
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.481
Aye, Captain.

464
00:45:55.559 --> 00:45:59.121
I am reconfiguring scanners
to modulate for the crew's signals.

465
00:46:03.199 --> 00:46:06.090
You're with me.
I left something behind.

466
00:46:17.559 --> 00:46:19.130
That is one heck of a cold.

467
00:46:19.199 --> 00:46:20.769
Nice job, Keenser.

468
00:46:23.199 --> 00:46:25.851
All right, we got about 15 minutes
until the next guard rotation. Come on.

469
00:46:34.039 --> 00:46:35.371
Let's go. Come on.

470
00:46:41.719 --> 00:46:42.960
Come on.

471
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.402
This is the Magellan Probe.

472
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.009
The Federation was using these
to find a way through the nebula.

473
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.327
What's he using it for?

474
00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.920
What do you see?

475
00:47:31.519 --> 00:47:35.161
He's been piggybacking
the subspace links between the probes.

476
00:47:35.239 --> 00:47:37.686
Can we use it to send a distress signal?

477
00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.487
I can try.

478
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.005
It's sent.

479
00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:48.242
He's accessed the Yorktown database.

480
00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.320
What?

481
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.202
He's got Starfleet data files, ship logs,

482
00:47:53.679 --> 00:47:55.329
including the Enterprise.

483
00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.007
He's been watching us this whole time.

484
00:48:14.519 --> 00:48:15.726
Captain,

485
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.050
the artifact was on the ship
the whole time?

486
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.927
I couldn't afford to get caught with it,
so I hid it in here.

487
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.322
Tell Krall I have the Abronath.

488
00:48:33.199 --> 00:48:35.521
Do you believe
every sad story you hear?

489
00:48:38.599 --> 00:48:40.443
Not every.

490
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.728
Put the phaser down.

491
00:48:43.239 --> 00:48:44.240
Please.

492
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.324
You get it, Chekov?

493
00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.364
Aye, Captain, I have traced
the location of her call.

494
00:48:59.639 --> 00:49:00.721
What does Krall want with this thing?

495
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.282
To save you

496
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.206
from yourselves.

497
00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:07.641
Captain!

498
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.690
- You all right?
- Aye, Captain,

499
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.563
but we are trapped!

500
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.440
Can you get this thing started?

501
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.086
Are you intimating
that we should engage the thrusters?

502
00:50:10.519 --> 00:50:11.851
I am open to other suggestions.

503
00:50:12.159 --> 00:50:13.889
Okay.

504
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.289
- There is a problem.
- What?

505
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.840
The fuel is primed,
but I cannot get it to combust.

506
00:50:21.559 --> 00:50:25.166
Oy, Captain, we are basically
standing on a very large bomb.

507
00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:26.365
If you miss
the combustion compressor...

508
00:50:26.639 --> 00:50:27.641
I'm not gonna miss, come on.

509
00:50:27.719 --> 00:50:29.528
Do you even know what
the combustion compressor looks like?

510
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.284
It's square, right?

511
00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.079
No, sir, it's round.

512
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.929
That's what I said.

513
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.847
Run!

514
00:50:57.960 --> 00:50:59.246
Go!

515
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.844
Chekov!

516
00:51:58.199 --> 00:51:59.530
Chekov! Move!

517
00:52:58.239 --> 00:53:00.367
You think you know

518
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.922
what sacrifice really means?

519
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:14.289
Federation has taught you
that conflict should not exist.

520
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.485
Ha!

521
00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.445
But without struggle,

522
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.445
you would never know who you truly are.

523
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.606
You have no idea who we are.

524
00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.646
But you'll soon find out.

525
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:38.123
You mean the distress signal
you thought you sent?

526
00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.083
The coordinates were altered.

527
00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.528
Your rescue ships
will be stranded in the nebula

528
00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:50.126
and your base left vulnerable.

529
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.802
You're going to attack Yorktown.

530
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:59.327
Millions of souls from every
Federation world holding hands.

531
00:54:01.039 --> 00:54:02.643
It's a perfect target.

532
00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.324
You're wrong. There is strength in unity.

533
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.847
The strength of others, Lieutenant,

534
00:54:15.079 --> 00:54:17.559
is what has kept me alive.

535
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.081
No!

536
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.440
Spock.

537
00:54:46.519 --> 00:54:48.362
Spock, wake up, damn it!

538
00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:53.568
I am entirely conscious, Doctor.

539
00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.362
I'm simply contemplating
the nature of mortality.

540
00:54:58.199 --> 00:54:59.690
Feeling philosophical, huh?

541
00:55:02.039 --> 00:55:05.202
Massive blood loss will do that to you.

542
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.327
You asked me why
Lieutenant Uhura and I parted ways.

543
00:55:12.719 --> 00:55:16.690
I became concerned,
in the light of Vulcan's demise,

544
00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.887
that I owed a debt of duty to my species.

545
00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:24.083
You thought you should be off
making little Vulcans, huh?

546
00:55:25.639 --> 00:55:27.927
Yeah, I can see
how that would upset her.

547
00:55:29.239 --> 00:55:31.083
I intended to discuss it with her further,

548
00:55:31.159 --> 00:55:34.289
but I received some news
which affected me unexpectedly.

549
00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.251
What news?

550
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.445
Ambassador Spock has died.

551
00:55:44.639 --> 00:55:45.766
Oh.

552
00:55:46.679 --> 00:55:48.681
Spock, I'm so sorry.

553
00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.764
I can't imagine what that must feel like.

554
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.284
When you've lived as many lives as he,

555
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.047
fear of death is illogical.

556
00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.123
Fear of death

557
00:56:13.559 --> 00:56:15.800
is what keeps us alive.

558
00:56:20.039 --> 00:56:21.963
I want to live as he did.

559
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.322
That is why I decided

560
00:56:28.039 --> 00:56:31.248
to redirect my efforts
and continue his work

561
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.280
on New Vulcan.

562
00:56:37.079 --> 00:56:39.081
You're leaving Starfleet?

563
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.407
What did Jim have to say about that?

564
00:56:47.039 --> 00:56:50.646
I could not find the time to tell him.

565
00:56:51.159 --> 00:56:53.322
Well, I can tell you
he's not gonna like that.

566
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.606
Hell, I don't know
what he'd do without you.

567
00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.246
I mean, me on the other hand,
I'd throw a party, but...

568
00:57:10.719 --> 00:57:12.847
My God, you're getting delirious.

569
00:57:19.199 --> 00:57:21.282
How far are we
from the coordinates of that call?

570
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.286
Still a ways, sir.

571
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:24.960
- Captain?
- Yeah.

572
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.206
When did you begin to suspect her?

573
00:57:30.119 --> 00:57:31.690
Not soon enough.

574
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.806
How did you know?

575
00:57:34.239 --> 00:57:35.240
Well...

576
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:39.929
I guess you could say
I've got a good nose for danger.

577
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.001
Run!

578
00:57:54.079 --> 00:57:55.445
Is that music?

579
00:57:55.519 --> 00:57:57.284
Where on earth is that coming from?

580
00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.280
There.

581
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.001
I plugged the little box in the power cell

582
00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:05.128
and the little mouths make it sing.

583
00:58:05.199 --> 00:58:06.804
That's very clever.

584
00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.009
Music's a bit old-fashioned for my taste,

585
00:58:09.079 --> 00:58:10.684
not to mention very loud and distracting,

586
00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.409
but, aye, well played.

587
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.804
I like the beats and shouting.

588
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.521
Oh, you do?

589
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.449
- Switch it off.
- Ach, you're okay.

590
00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:24.250
Switch it off!

591
00:58:27.159 --> 00:58:29.242
Someone set off one of my traps.

592
00:58:34.199 --> 00:58:36.043
Shh.

593
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.001
Captain?

594
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.648
- You know these men?
- Aye, lassie.

595
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.047
- That wee man there is Pavel Chekov.
- Hello.

596
00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:01.487
And that handsome bastard
is James T. Kirk.

597
00:59:01.599 --> 00:59:02.840
They're my mates.

598
00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.045
It's good to see you, sir.

599
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.489
What is she doing, Scotty?

600
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.159
Don't hurt them. No, don't!

601
00:59:09.719 --> 00:59:10.766
Hit her!

602
00:59:13.119 --> 00:59:15.963
- You're free, James T.
- There we go.

603
00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:17.721
Mr. Scott.

604
00:59:23.599 --> 00:59:25.364
Who's your new friend here?

605
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.719
She sure knows
how to throw out a welcome mat.

606
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.007
- This is Jaylah.
- I do not know what is a welcome mat.

607
00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.246
- You find anybody else?
- No, sir.

608
00:59:33.559 --> 00:59:34.971
I'm sorry, you're the only ones.

609
00:59:35.039 --> 00:59:36.963
What the hell happened up there, Jim?
Why were we attacked?

610
00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.567
They were after the artifact
we brought back from Teenax.

611
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.001
- Did they get it?
- No.

612
00:59:41.079 --> 00:59:42.081
- Have you got it?
- No.

613
00:59:42.159 --> 00:59:43.923
I had to get it off the Enterprise,
put it on a shuttle.

614
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.402
- You hid it in a shuttle.
- Yes.

615
00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.121
And no.

616
01:00:02.039 --> 01:00:05.442
This is the U. S. S. Franklin, sir.
Can you believe it?

617
01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.760
First Earth ship capable of warp 4.

618
01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.889
Went missing in the Gagarin
Radiation Belt in the early 2160s.

619
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.411
I remember that
from the Academy.

620
01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.050
Captain Balthazar Edison.

621
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.050
One of the first heroes of Starfleet.

622
01:00:16.119 --> 01:00:17.929
How the hell did his ship end up here?

623
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.331
There's a lot of theories, sir.

624
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.688
Surrendered to the Romulans.
Captured by a giant green space hand.

625
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.001
This far out,
it's got to be a wormhole displacement.

626
01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.240
Can she fly?

627
01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.809
She's missing a few driver coils

628
01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.291
and the EPS conduits are fried,

629
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.362
but Jaylah has done a marvelous job

630
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.402
of getting the ship's systems
back online.

631
01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.847
- Thank you, Montgomery Scotty.
- Pardon me.

632
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.161
Mr. Chekov,
can you plug in the coordinates.

633
01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.806
See if you can track the crew's location
from the ship's sensors.

634
01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.085
Aye, Captain.

635
01:00:44.199 --> 01:00:45.690
- He likes that seat.
- Mr. Scott.

636
01:00:46.119 --> 01:00:47.769
- Tour.
- Yes, the mess hall.

637
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.887
- Jaylah, if you will.
- Yes.

638
01:01:12.199 --> 01:01:14.327
No clue
what happened to the crew, huh?

639
01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.161
No, sir. They'd be dead
a hundred years by now.

640
01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.561
Is that a...

641
01:01:23.239 --> 01:01:25.048
That's a PX70!

642
01:01:27.679 --> 01:01:28.920
Wow.

643
01:01:29.559 --> 01:01:32.085
My dad used to have one
when he was a kid.

644
01:01:32.719 --> 01:01:36.440
My mom said he'd put her
on the back of it, drive her nuts.

645
01:01:39.639 --> 01:01:40.641
Sir.

646
01:01:41.119 --> 01:01:42.121
Um...

647
01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.405
So you're telling me
this thing's been here this whole time

648
01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.481
and no one's ever noticed it?

649
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.606
She's rigged up
image refractors.

650
01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.121
Here.

651
01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.369
So, like some sort of
holographic camouflage.

652
01:02:07.639 --> 01:02:08.880
Aye, sir.

653
01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.041
Captain!

654
01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:15.329
I have intercepted a weak
communications transmission, sir.

655
01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.764
It's a Starfleet frequency.

656
01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.802
Can you lock on to the signal?

657
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.007
Yes, but how do we get to them?

658
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.081
I have an idea, sir.

659
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.085
But I'm gonna need your permission.

660
01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.960
Why would you need my permission?

661
01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:32.724
Because if I mess it up,
I don't want it to be just my fault.

662
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.284
McCoy and Spock to Enterprise crew.
Come in, Enterprise crew.

663
01:02:40.159 --> 01:02:41.206
Anyone.

664
01:02:46.039 --> 01:02:47.371
Come on, Spock.

665
01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.007
Come on, you can make it.

666
01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.121
Leaving me behind
will significantly increase

667
01:02:54.199 --> 01:02:55.884
your chances of survival, Doctor.

668
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.286
Well, that's damn chivalrous of you,

669
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.521
but completely out of the question.

670
01:02:58.599 --> 01:03:01.762
It is imperative that
you locate any surviving crew.

671
01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.530
And here I was thinking you cared.

672
01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.164
Of course I care, Leonard.

673
01:03:15.519 --> 01:03:18.603
I always assumed
my respect for you was clear.

674
01:03:21.039 --> 01:03:23.565
The dialogue we have had
across the years has always...

675
01:03:23.639 --> 01:03:24.880
It's okay, Spock.

676
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.403
You don't have to say it.

677
01:03:31.159 --> 01:03:33.811
Well, at least I won't die alone.

678
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.570
Well, that's just typical.

679
01:03:45.639 --> 01:03:47.608
Come on, you bastards!

680
01:03:54.119 --> 01:03:55.201
Oh.

681
01:03:55.639 --> 01:03:56.686
Good to see you in one piece, Doctor.

682
01:03:57.039 --> 01:03:58.201
Oh, am I?

683
01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.682
I feel like my innards
have been to a barn dance!

684
01:04:01.079 --> 01:04:03.242
Aye, well, these old transporters
were only ever used for cargo,

685
01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.690
but a few modifications
seem to do the trick.

686
01:04:05.159 --> 01:04:06.923
I thought it best
to beam you one at a time, though.

687
01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.567
- You know, in case you got spliced.
- Oh.

688
01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.090
I couldn't imagine a worse scenario.

689
01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.007
Good to have you back. You all right?

690
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.686
Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt.

691
01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.648
I am functioning adequately, Captain.

692
01:04:17.719 --> 01:04:18.846
In a pig's eye, you are!

693
01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.967
Captain, we discovered
that the stolen artifact

694
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.764
appears to have
come from this planet.

695
01:04:23.599 --> 01:04:24.601
Damn it, Spock.

696
01:04:25.559 --> 01:04:27.164
Are there any medical supplies
on this thing?

697
01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:28.240
This way.

698
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.367
All right. Lie down. Come on.

699
01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.407
There you go.

700
01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.284
How are we gonna get out
of this one, Spock?

701
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.681
We've got no ship, no crew.
Not the best odds.

702
01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.329
We will do
what we have always done, Jim.

703
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.766
We will find hope in the impossible.

704
01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.251
Let's get you patched up first, okay?

705
01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320
No, Captain.

706
01:04:52.719 --> 01:04:54.403
You must focus your efforts
on helping the crew.

707
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.768
Well, that's why
I need you around, Spock.

708
01:05:00.239 --> 01:05:01.650
These things are from the dark ages.

709
01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:04.485
Bones.

710
01:05:05.719 --> 01:05:08.485
I'm pretty sure this is a protoplaser.

711
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.563
Should stop the internal hemorrhaging.

712
01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.007
At least that's my hope.

713
01:05:12.559 --> 01:05:14.847
"The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope."

714
01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:19.644
Death's door
and he's quoting Shakespeare.

715
01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:25.521
Captain's Log, Stardate 2262.18.

716
01:05:26.559 --> 01:05:28.369
The mission, routine investigation...

717
01:05:40.119 --> 01:05:41.610
If the universe is truly endless...

718
01:05:41.679 --> 01:05:44.570
What seemed so clear to me
two years ago now seems,

719
01:05:44.639 --> 01:05:46.483
well, far away.

720
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.844
You will tell me where it is!

721
01:05:52.159 --> 01:05:53.161
Now!

722
01:05:57.519 --> 01:05:58.521
Stop! Stop!

723
01:06:00.599 --> 01:06:02.045
Let him go
and I will give you what you want!

724
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:03.851
No! Syl, don't!

725
01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:33.121
Lieutenant, unity is not your strength.

726
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.445
It is your weakness.

727
01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:15.925
We should wait
until we're absolutely sure.

728
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.445
No, we have to get the crew back now.

729
01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:21.726
Chekov has the coordinates that can
lead us to Krall's base, so we go!

730
01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:24.286
With respect, sir, how do we know
that Krall was at the base

731
01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:25.521
when she called him?

732
01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:27.523
Even if he was, we don't know
that the crew is even with him.

733
01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:28.567
Or if they're even still alive.

734
01:07:28.639 --> 01:07:30.768
Mr. Chekov, can you reconfigure
the search parameters

735
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:33.161
in order to compensate for this formula?

736
01:07:33.239 --> 01:07:36.925
Aye, Commander,
but what is this formula?

737
01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.445
It is Vokaya, Mr. Chekov.

738
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.490
A mineral unique to Vulcan
which emits low-level radiation.

739
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.445
I will have to filter out
all other energy emissions.

740
01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.400
Spock, what the hell would a Vulcan
mineral be doing way out here?

741
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.811
Where are you going with this?

742
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.688
Lieutenant Uhura
wears a Vokaya amulet

743
01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.365
which I presented to her
as a token of my affection and respect.

744
01:07:54.199 --> 01:07:56.327
You gave your girlfriend
radioactive jewelry?

745
01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.400
The emission
is harmless, Doctor.

746
01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.121
But its unique signature
makes it very easy to identify.

747
01:08:00.719 --> 01:08:03.371
You gave your girlfriend
a tracking device.

748
01:08:06.639 --> 01:08:07.721
That was not my intention.

749
01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.521
I'm glad he doesn't respect me.

750
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.251
Huh.

751
01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:26.721
I am detecting
a very trace amount of Vokaya.

752
01:08:27.239 --> 01:08:28.650
Does the location match the coordinates

753
01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.085
you acquired from Kalara, Mr. Chekov?

754
01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.244
It is a match, sir.

755
01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:35.051
Its presence suggests that Lieutenant
Uhura and thereby the rest of the crew

756
01:08:35.119 --> 01:08:37.087
are being held
at Krall's base of operation.

757
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.645
Can you beam them out?

758
01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:41.886
No, sir. There is some
geological interference

759
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.280
that is blocking the transporter signal.

760
01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:45.725
Well, I guess we're gonna have to go in

761
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.324
and break them out
the old-fashioned way.

762
01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.926
You cannot go to this place.

763
01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.887
Everyone who goes there, he kills.

764
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.807
You've...
You've been there? You've seen it?

765
01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:58.923
Well, why didn't you
say something, lassie?

766
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.570
Because I know you will
ask me to take you there.

767
01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:06.408
If your friends are there,
then they will die, just like my family.

768
01:09:07.119 --> 01:09:09.327
And I will not go back
to that death place!

769
01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.686
Aye, but if you've escaped,

770
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.250
then you can show us
the way in and the way out.

771
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.489
No! This is not the deal we made,
Montgomery Scotty.

772
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.046
If you choose to do this,
you are on your own.

773
01:09:21.039 --> 01:09:22.041
Wait.

774
01:09:22.119 --> 01:09:23.201
Let her go.

775
01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:25.442
She's lost people, too, Captain.

776
01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:36.601
Look, that's our friends out there,
lassie. Right?

777
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.444
We cannae just leave them behind.

778
01:09:39.039 --> 01:09:41.884
Now, we could really use your help.

779
01:09:42.239 --> 01:09:43.969
We just need you to be brave, is all.

780
01:09:46.239 --> 01:09:48.640
When we were in that place,

781
01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.961
Krall would come and take someone.

782
01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.289
There were screams.

783
01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.449
I can still hear them.

784
01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.689
And we would not see
that person again.

785
01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:01.081
We did not know who would be next.

786
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.807
My father planned an escape.

787
01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.007
But we were seen
by the one they call Manas.

788
01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.162
My father fought him so I could get out.

789
01:10:20.319 --> 01:10:23.289
He was brave and Manas killed him.

790
01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.807
What you want is impossible.

791
01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.524
Look, maybe it's not.

792
01:10:33.439 --> 01:10:37.001
Right. My wee granny used to say,
"Ya cannae break a stick in a bundle."

793
01:10:38.479 --> 01:10:40.846
You're part of
something bigger now, lassie.

794
01:10:41.319 --> 01:10:42.890
Right? Dinnae give up on that.

795
01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.927
'Cause we'll sure as hell
never give up on you.

796
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.967
That is what being part of a crew
is all about.

797
01:10:49.039 --> 01:10:51.167
Is that what you believe in, James T.?

798
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.002
All I know is we stand
a better chance with you.

799
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.844
The digging machines uncovered
a tunnel that goes into the crater.

800
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.081
That's how I got out.

801
01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:04.844
So that'll be our way in.

802
01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.967
An away team will beam
to the other side of the tunnel,

803
01:11:07.039 --> 01:11:08.201
follow it to Krall's base,

804
01:11:08.279 --> 01:11:10.203
get inside the building
and break out the crew.

805
01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.604
Uh, Captain, we cannot lock
onto anyone inside the crater

806
01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.841
in order to beam them out.

807
01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.082
Oh, I could rig up pulse beacons
as pattern enhancers.

808
01:11:17.159 --> 01:11:18.286
That'd get the signal out of the crater.

809
01:11:18.359 --> 01:11:19.360
- All right.
- How many people can

810
01:11:19.439 --> 01:11:20.725
the Franklin transport at a time?

811
01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:23.041
Uh, with a wee bit
of modification, 20 Max,

812
01:11:23.119 --> 01:11:24.962
but I'm not sure
how long it would hold out.

813
01:11:25.039 --> 01:11:26.279
Bones, Mr. Chekov, Jaylah,

814
01:11:26.359 --> 01:11:27.440
you're with me on the away team.

815
01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.363
Mr. Scott, modify that transporter

816
01:11:29.439 --> 01:11:31.521
and then do everything you can
to get this ship operational.

817
01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.368
Captain, Mr. Chekov's technical acumen

818
01:11:33.439 --> 01:11:36.204
makes him more valuable
aboard the Franklin with Mr. Scott.

819
01:11:36.279 --> 01:11:38.122
It is thereby logical
that I would replace him.

820
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.880
Why is that logical, Spock?

821
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.006
You just got back on your feet.

822
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.921
Lieutenant Uhura is in that facility, Jim.

823
01:11:47.399 --> 01:11:48.765
I'll keep an eye on him.

824
01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.765
Understood.

825
01:11:51.319 --> 01:11:52.845
But his soldiers are everywhere.

826
01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.364
We won't pass unseen.

827
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.051
What we require is a diversion.

828
01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.726
I think I have an idea.

829
01:12:29.399 --> 01:12:32.243
This is Abronath.

830
01:12:33.079 --> 01:12:36.926
It was used by the Ancient Ones
as a weapon.

831
01:12:37.359 --> 01:12:40.488
But when they could not
control its deadly power,

832
01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:42.801
they split it into two

833
01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.287
and ejected the halves into space,

834
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.001
hoping it would be lost forever.

835
01:12:52.119 --> 01:12:54.407
But I am grateful.

836
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.168
I have spent lifetimes searching for it,

837
01:12:59.239 --> 01:13:01.162
only to have you

838
01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.641
find it for me.

839
01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.087
The poetry of fate.

840
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.489
The world that I was born into

841
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.087
is very different from yours, Lieutenant.

842
01:13:18.159 --> 01:13:20.845
We knew pain. We knew terror.

843
01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:24.048
Struggle made us strong.

844
01:13:24.119 --> 01:13:27.090
Not peace. Not unity.

845
01:13:27.159 --> 01:13:31.085
These are myths
the Federation would have you believe.

846
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.841
Those are strong words.

847
01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.041
You might even believe them,

848
01:13:39.119 --> 01:13:41.360
but there's something else
going on with you.

849
01:13:41.439 --> 01:13:42.965
Something underneath.

850
01:13:44.199 --> 01:13:45.201
Uhura!

851
01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.006
Wait.

852
01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.039
What are you doing with her?

853
01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.529
You already got what you wanted!
Let her go!

854
01:13:54.359 --> 01:13:55.565
Syl!

855
01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.126
No, please!

856
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.489
Let her go!

857
01:14:31.359 --> 01:14:33.726
Manas, it's time.

858
01:14:36.079 --> 01:14:39.288
The Federation has pushed
the frontier for centuries.

859
01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:41.444
But no longer.

860
01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.161
This is where it begins, Lieutenant.

861
01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.842
This is where the frontier pushes back.

862
01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.886
This way.

863
01:15:22.119 --> 01:15:23.405
Where is she?

864
01:15:44.079 --> 01:15:46.207
I've got to admit,
that's a hell of a distraction.

865
01:15:47.399 --> 01:15:48.480
Your friends are over there.

866
01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.246
Come on.

867
01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:09.286
Go!

868
01:16:42.399 --> 01:16:44.801
Commander. Uhura, they took her.

869
01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.289
Get the remainder of the crew to safety.

870
01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.850
Come on, let's go! Move!

871
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.283
- Stay in the circle.
- Come on! Hurry!

872
01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.600
I've got them, Mr. Scott!

873
01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.323
Okay, Mr. Chekov, increase the signal.

874
01:17:02.399 --> 01:17:03.925
We're gonna grab them 20 at a time.

875
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.809
- Aye.
- Let's hope this doesn't get messy.

876
01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.404
Energize!

877
01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.006
Spock.

878
01:17:44.119 --> 01:17:45.962
What are you doing here?

879
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.408
Clearly, I am here to rescue you.

880
01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.881
Let's go.

881
01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.805
Good to see you, wee man.

882
01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:24.969
Ten seconds until
the transporter's recharged, Doctor.

883
01:19:25.039 --> 01:19:27.007
- Wait for my signal.
- Doctor!

884
01:19:27.079 --> 01:19:29.082
Damn it, man,
we're not leaving without them!

885
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.364
Come on. Let's go. Move!

886
01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.966
Let's go! Come on!

887
01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.167
We're ready for you next,
Captain. Just turn on your beacon.

888
01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.930
Scotty, do you have everybody?

889
01:20:05.399 --> 01:20:06.400
Aye, sir. Everyone
except you and Jaylah.

890
01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.845
Hit the beacon and we'll grab you.

891
01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:25.121
Captain, your beacon!

892
01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.199
- There it is!
- Energize.

893
01:21:01.039 --> 01:21:02.529
Jaylah, now!

894
01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:17.161
Okay...

895
01:21:17.479 --> 01:21:19.403
Let's never do that again.

896
01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.250
I agree, James T.

897
01:21:24.439 --> 01:21:25.440
You all right?

898
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.962
Captain! This thing he has...

899
01:21:28.039 --> 01:21:31.646
Yorktown. He's gonna destroy Yorktown.

900
01:21:33.359 --> 01:21:35.010
You take my house

901
01:21:36.199 --> 01:21:37.963
and you make it fly.

902
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:42.728
Scotty, can you get this thing started?

903
01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.801
Started, yes.
Flying, sir, that's a different thing.

904
01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.489
These old vessels,
they were built in space.

905
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.961
They were never supposed
to take off from atmosphere.

906
01:21:49.039 --> 01:21:50.166
Make it happen.

907
01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:52.082
They're called starships
for a reason, Captain.

908
01:21:52.159 --> 01:21:53.729
You're telling me this now?

909
01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:55.131
Because I didn't want
to disappoint you, you know,

910
01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:57.167
in case you didn't make it back.

911
01:21:57.239 --> 01:21:59.480
- How thoughtful, Mr. Scott.
- Captain.

912
01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:07.640
He's launching.

913
01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.444
The attack on Yorktown
may be just the beginning.

914
01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:20.444
Armed with this bio-weapon,
he could rid it of all life

915
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.841
and use the base's advanced technology

916
01:22:22.319 --> 01:22:24.243
to attack an untold number
of Federation planets.

917
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.363
Then we're just gonna have to
get this thing flying.

918
01:22:28.439 --> 01:22:30.168
We cannae just jumpstart it, sir!

919
01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.881
Okay! All systems online.

920
01:22:38.079 --> 01:22:41.561
Dilithium chambers
at 70% and climbing.

921
01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:44.411
Primary support engines standing by.

922
01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.045
Mr. Sulu.

923
01:22:48.119 --> 01:22:51.805
You can, you know, fly this thing, right?

924
01:22:53.279 --> 01:22:54.440
You kidding me, sir?

925
01:22:55.039 --> 01:22:56.279
Fantastic.

926
01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:58.724
Scotty, how we looking?

927
01:22:59.079 --> 01:23:00.365
Ready as she'll ever be, sir.

928
01:23:00.439 --> 01:23:01.930
That's what I like to hear. All right.

929
01:23:02.319 --> 01:23:03.810
Bones, where are we with the crew?

930
01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.404
I could use a functioning med-bay,

931
01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.085
but otherwise we're secure down here.

932
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.006
Mr. Sulu, we have to achieve
terminal velocity

933
01:23:11.079 --> 01:23:13.525
in order for the stabilizers
to provide lift.

934
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.489
Are you sure this drop
is high enough to do that?

935
01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.251
We'll find out.

936
01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.769
Call it, Mr. Sulu.

937
01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:31.479
Aye-aye, Captain.

938
01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.809
Mr. Chekov, be ready to hit
the forward stabilizers full on my mark.

939
01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.119
- One quarter impulse.
- Aye.

940
01:23:58.279 --> 01:24:00.282
One half impulse, Mr. Chekov.

941
01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.646
Aye.

942
01:24:03.159 --> 01:24:04.764
We should belt up. Go on. Go!

943
01:24:14.279 --> 01:24:16.680
Easy, Mr. Sulu.
Let's not break her in half.

944
01:24:52.039 --> 01:24:53.689
Any time, Mr. Sulu.

945
01:24:59.199 --> 01:25:00.610
Now, Mr. Chekov!

946
01:26:13.279 --> 01:26:15.930
IFF alert on incoming vessel.

947
01:26:16.319 --> 01:26:19.051
No reply to all-frequency I.D. request.

948
01:26:19.119 --> 01:26:20.167
Visual.

949
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.086
Red alert! Red alert!

950
01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:48.884
Look how far they've come.

951
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:53.125
Please proceed

952
01:26:53.199 --> 01:26:55.042
to designated safety zones immediately.

953
01:26:57.439 --> 01:26:59.521
Please proceed to designated
safety zones immediately.

954
01:27:02.199 --> 01:27:03.610
I'm picking up distress signals

955
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.126
from every frequency
coming from Yorktown.

956
01:27:07.399 --> 01:27:09.402
Krall's already started his attack.

957
01:27:09.479 --> 01:27:11.403
Mr. Scott, what kind of weapons
do we have?

958
01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.485
Uh, we have pulsed phase cannons
and spatial torpedoes.

959
01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.560
Great. Lock and load.

960
01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.246
It does not matter.
You cannot defeat the bees.

961
01:27:19.319 --> 01:27:21.560
Maybe, uh, maybe we lure them away.

962
01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.006
How do we get Yorktown time
to get people to safety?

963
01:27:24.079 --> 01:27:26.127
No, we are a horse and buggy
compared to those things.

964
01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:28.088
We're barely holding together
as it is, Captain.

965
01:27:28.239 --> 01:27:32.086
Captain, the flight patterns of bees
are determined by individual decisions.

966
01:27:32.159 --> 01:27:34.560
Krall's swarm formations
are too complex not to rely

967
01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:37.240
on some form of unified
cyberpathic coordination.

968
01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:39.606
- I surmise that if we...
- Spock! Skip to the end.

969
01:27:40.039 --> 01:27:41.929
What he's saying is that
if we disorient the swarm

970
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.684
we can kick its ass!

971
01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:45.524
Precisely.

972
01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:48.329
Scotty, can you beam me
onto one of those swarm ships?

973
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.680
Have you gone completely mad?

974
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.001
- Yes or no?
- No!

975
01:27:51.359 --> 01:27:52.407
Yes!

976
01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.680
Maybe.

977
01:27:54.319 --> 01:27:56.560
Captain, my familiarity
of the interior of those ships,

978
01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.881
however brief, makes me more qualified
for this away mission.

979
01:27:59.319 --> 01:28:01.048
Spock, you're still hurt.

980
01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.045
She's right, Spock.

981
01:28:04.399 --> 01:28:06.083
I acknowledge
and respect your concerns.

982
01:28:07.439 --> 01:28:10.171
Perhaps you would feel more confident
if I were accompanied by someone

983
01:28:10.239 --> 01:28:12.447
with familiarity of both
the ship and my injury.

984
01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.123
He's gonna love this.

985
01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:18.926
You want me to do what?

986
01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.846
- Come along, Doctor.
- Whoa! Wait a minute.

987
01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.604
Why, you green-blooded ingrate.

988
01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.886
This was your idea!

989
01:28:26.479 --> 01:28:27.480
It's a good idea, Bones.

990
01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:29.484
You know, next time
you have a piece of pipe

991
01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.881
stuck in your transverse, call a plumber.

992
01:28:32.239 --> 01:28:33.570
Just make sure you find a way
to break those things.

993
01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.564
If it gets hairy,
I'll beam you straight back.

994
01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:36.921
Energize.

995
01:28:37.239 --> 01:28:38.240
You're gonna do great!

996
01:28:39.239 --> 01:28:40.844
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a...

997
01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:52.730
You do realize the last time
I flew one of these things we crashed.

998
01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.087
So don't blame me if we...

999
01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.801
Hit something.

1000
01:29:01.479 --> 01:29:02.480
Spock to Franklin.

1001
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.001
Spock, we read you.

1002
01:29:04.079 --> 01:29:05.365
Captain, from what I can ascertain,

1003
01:29:05.439 --> 01:29:07.203
the ships do indeed share
a cyberpathic link

1004
01:29:07.319 --> 01:29:08.560
which coordinates their actions.

1005
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.880
Patching it through now.

1006
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.762
That's what that signal was.

1007
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.240
They weren't jamming us,
they were talking to each other.

1008
01:29:16.319 --> 01:29:18.527
Well, how do we get them
to stop talking?

1009
01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.363
What about electromagnetic focusing?

1010
01:29:20.439 --> 01:29:22.090
We could use the transporters,
disrupt their network.

1011
01:29:22.159 --> 01:29:23.844
The focus might be too specific.

1012
01:29:24.159 --> 01:29:27.050
If we could plant some sort of disruptive
communication signal inside the swarm,

1013
01:29:27.119 --> 01:29:29.202
it might adversely affect
their capacity to coordinate.

1014
01:29:29.279 --> 01:29:31.850
It would have to be
at a frequency they will not anticipate.

1015
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:33.046
We could cause a chain reaction

1016
01:29:33.119 --> 01:29:34.167
that would wipe out the whole swarm.

1017
01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.930
Sir, a closed network like that

1018
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.605
might be susceptible
to very high frequency.

1019
01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.291
VHF.

1020
01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.087
Radio. We can broadcast something
from the ship to drown out their link.

1021
01:29:44.159 --> 01:29:45.764
Something loud and distracting.

1022
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:47.444
Loud and distracting?

1023
01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.926
I've got just the thing!

1024
01:29:50.479 --> 01:29:51.970
Do not break my music.

1025
01:29:52.359 --> 01:29:53.645
Break it? You're getting an upgrade.

1026
01:30:07.479 --> 01:30:09.608
Swarm ships are 60 seconds
from breaking through!

1027
01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.408
I've just got to reconfigure
the VHF output

1028
01:30:11.479 --> 01:30:13.050
into a multiphasic sweep.

1029
01:30:13.119 --> 01:30:14.280
Let me do it.

1030
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.761
Let her do it.

1031
01:30:18.159 --> 01:30:19.445
You do it.

1032
01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.403
There, see? Simple.

1033
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.681
All right. Captain,
we're ready to broadcast.

1034
01:30:26.199 --> 01:30:28.850
But the signal won't travel far.
We have to get closer.

1035
01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.762
- How close?
- Very.

1036
01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:33.162
Intercept course, Mr. Sulu.

1037
01:30:33.279 --> 01:30:34.645
Put us right in the middle of that thing.

1038
01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.881
Yes, sir.

1039
01:30:48.239 --> 01:30:50.048
My old friend.

1040
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.649
The swarm ships are doubling back!

1041
01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.448
They are forming an attack wave, sir.

1042
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.970
I think we got their attention.

1043
01:31:06.039 --> 01:31:08.042
Hold steady, Mr. Sulu.
Brace yourselves, everybody.

1044
01:31:08.119 --> 01:31:09.884
Spock, stand by
to drop out of formation.

1045
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.122
- Scotty, you all cued up back there?
- Aye, sir!

1046
01:31:12.199 --> 01:31:14.680
Ready to broadcast at 57.7 megahertz.

1047
01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.806
Made your choice, lassie?

1048
01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.609
I have the beat and shouting.

1049
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.364
Let's make some noise.

1050
01:31:51.039 --> 01:31:52.166
That's a good choice.

1051
01:32:06.159 --> 01:32:08.845
Faster, Doctor. We risk being
consumed by their trajectorial decay.

1052
01:32:09.279 --> 01:32:10.280
Damn backseat driver.

1053
01:32:11.119 --> 01:32:13.282
- Evade, Doctor!
- I see it, I see it!

1054
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.809
Is that classical music?

1055
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.809
Yes, Doctor, it would seem to be.

1056
01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.609
Lieutenant Uhura, make sure Yorktown
has the frequency to broadcast.

1057
01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.921
Sir, we now have
the disruption frequency.

1058
01:32:47.039 --> 01:32:48.166
Broadcast.

1059
01:33:09.199 --> 01:33:11.600
- You two all right, Spock?
- We are fine, Captain,

1060
01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.842
but there are still three ships
heading into Yorktown.

1061
01:33:14.279 --> 01:33:15.963
That's got to be Krall.
Keep on him, Spock.

1062
01:33:16.039 --> 01:33:19.168
Do whatever it takes to stop him
from using that weapon.

1063
01:33:38.319 --> 01:33:39.970
My house is breaking!

1064
01:33:40.439 --> 01:33:42.841
We've lost the polarization
of the hull plating!

1065
01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.082
I can reroute the power
from the dilithium chambers.

1066
01:33:45.159 --> 01:33:46.207
I need you.

1067
01:33:46.279 --> 01:33:48.680
And I need you, Jaylah. Let's go!

1068
01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.005
Do not lose them, Doctor.

1069
01:34:15.079 --> 01:34:17.207
You're more than welcome
to switch places with me, Spock.

1070
01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.682
Captain, intercepting
all three ships is an impossibility.

1071
01:34:46.279 --> 01:34:48.328
Get me a schematic of Yorktown!

1072
01:34:49.279 --> 01:34:51.362
There! Yorktown headquarters!

1073
01:34:51.439 --> 01:34:54.204
Mr. Chekov, can you do
a bioscan of Central Plaza?

1074
01:34:54.279 --> 01:34:55.327
Aye.

1075
01:34:55.399 --> 01:34:57.050
They are clearing civilians.

1076
01:34:57.119 --> 01:34:59.009
Bones, there's a city plaza coming up.

1077
01:34:59.119 --> 01:35:01.202
You gotta make sure Krall heads for it.

1078
01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:02.327
- Why?
- Just do it!

1079
01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.045
Sulu, get us up there.

1080
01:35:20.119 --> 01:35:21.645
Hold onto something!

1081
01:36:16.199 --> 01:36:18.362
- Great work, Bones.
- Thanks, Jim.

1082
01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.569
Now I've just got to
figure out how to land.

1083
01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.451
Captain, I have three hull breaches
from the impact.

1084
01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.046
Deck 3, the cargo bay,
and the engine room.

1085
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.604
All right, Sulu, Chekov,
check the cargo bay and Deck 3.

1086
01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.761
We need confirmation
that the weapon has been neutralized

1087
01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.921
and Krall is dead!

1088
01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:58.801
Captain!

1089
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.761
It's Krall.

1090
01:37:07.079 --> 01:37:08.524
We've seen him do this.

1091
01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:12.046
It's some kind of energy transference.
It physically changes him.

1092
01:37:12.119 --> 01:37:15.886
He must still be onboard.
We would have seen him leave.

1093
01:37:17.399 --> 01:37:20.404
Sulu, contact Yorktown security
and lock down the ship.

1094
01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:21.841
Let's go.

1095
01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.329
Push the frontier.

1096
01:37:45.199 --> 01:37:46.280
It's about damn time.

1097
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.041
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1098
01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:51.122
All right, baby, let's go.

1099
01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:53.042
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1100
01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.805
Captain!

1101
01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.404
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1102
01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.768
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1103
01:38:06.479 --> 01:38:08.243
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1104
01:38:09.159 --> 01:38:10.969
- It's about damn time.
- Push the frontier.

1105
01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.011
...frontier.

1106
01:38:15.479 --> 01:38:17.005
...frontier.

1107
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.126
It's him.

1108
01:38:25.319 --> 01:38:28.483
Scotty, I need you to link
into the Franklin database.

1109
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.881
Find out what you can
about Balthazar Edison.

1110
01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.769
- The captain of the Franklin?
- Yeah.

1111
01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.489
- Sir, he'll be long dead.
- No. He's not.

1112
01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.689
I don't know how, but Edison is Krall.

1113
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:48.881
What'd you find?

1114
01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.199
His record goes back

1115
01:38:50.319 --> 01:38:51.890
way before the Federation even existed.

1116
01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.170
He was a major in
the United Earth Military Assault

1117
01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.681
Command Operation.
A lot of off-world combat.

1118
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:57.761
He was a soldier.

1119
01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.966
Aye, sir.
And a pretty good one.

1120
01:38:59.039 --> 01:39:01.520
His military service came to an end
when MACO was disbanded.

1121
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:03.842
- Why, what happened?
- The Federation, sir. Starfleet.

1122
01:39:04.319 --> 01:39:05.320
We're not a military agency.

1123
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.045
They made him a captain
and gave him the Franklin.

1124
01:39:07.479 --> 01:39:09.686
- Scotty, bring up his logs.
- Aye, sir.

1125
01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:13.121
- Captain's Log...
- Last entry.

1126
01:39:13.439 --> 01:39:17.206
Captain's Log...
I don't remember the Stardate.

1127
01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.042
All distress calls unanswered.

1128
01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:22.765
Of the crew,

1129
01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:25.970
only three remain.

1130
01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.483
I won't allow it!

1131
01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.042
The indigenous race
abandoned this planet long ago.

1132
01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.564
They left behind sophisticated
mining equipment

1133
01:39:38.039 --> 01:39:39.564
and a drone workforce.

1134
01:39:40.399 --> 01:39:43.243
They have some sort of technology

1135
01:39:43.319 --> 01:39:46.323
that prolongs life.

1136
01:39:47.119 --> 01:39:50.123
I will do whatever it takes
for me and my crew.

1137
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.761
The Federation do not care about us.

1138
01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.451
You'll probably never see me again.

1139
01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.925
But if you do,

1140
01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:05.930
be ready.

1141
01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:09.210
Why has he not used his weapon yet?

1142
01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.761
'Cause he wants to find somewhere
to inflict maximum damage.

1143
01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:13.770
He needs a distribution system.

1144
01:40:15.439 --> 01:40:16.487
They have to circulate air here, right?

1145
01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.365
Aye, sir. There's an atmospheric
regulator at the core.

1146
01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.643
Lieutenant, contact Yorktown.
Make sure they shut it down

1147
01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:22.960
- until we find Krall.
- Yes.

1148
01:40:23.439 --> 01:40:24.520
How would he access the core?

1149
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.849
Uh, well, there's a maintenance tower

1150
01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.161
at the station's gravitational nexus.
That's the only way.

1151
01:40:29.479 --> 01:40:31.926
Scotty, you get over there.
Make sure it gets shut down!

1152
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.126
Lassie, you're with me.

1153
01:40:46.479 --> 01:40:48.766
Look, this thing
is impossible to shut down.

1154
01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.126
Aye, well,

1155
01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.324
we'll see about that.

1156
01:41:01.079 --> 01:41:02.809
Mr. Scott, why is that thing still on?

1157
01:41:03.159 --> 01:41:04.161
We're working on it, sir,

1158
01:41:04.239 --> 01:41:06.368
but as you can imagine
there's a lot of safety protocols

1159
01:41:06.439 --> 01:41:07.520
surrounding the thing that, you know,

1160
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.927
- keeps everybody alive.
- Figure something out.

1161
01:41:10.119 --> 01:41:11.121
Be careful, Captain.

1162
01:41:11.199 --> 01:41:12.850
Gravity's gonna get a bit screwy

1163
01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.529
the closer you get to the center.

1164
01:41:15.039 --> 01:41:16.451
Maybe we should scan
the operational schematics,

1165
01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.010
- see if there's a back door.
- Right.

1166
01:41:18.319 --> 01:41:19.605
Lassie, I'm gonna need your eyes.

1167
01:41:29.079 --> 01:41:30.161
Stop!

1168
01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:39.962
What happened to you
out there, Edison?

1169
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.239
Edison.

1170
01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:48.881
I have to say, Kirk,

1171
01:41:50.199 --> 01:41:52.850
I've missed being me.

1172
01:41:54.039 --> 01:41:58.203
We lost ourselves but gained a purpose!

1173
01:41:59.039 --> 01:42:01.520
A means to bring the galaxy

1174
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.320
back to the struggle
that made humanity strong.

1175
01:42:06.199 --> 01:42:07.725
I think you underestimate humanity.

1176
01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:10.082
I fought for humanity!

1177
01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:14.884
Lost millions to the Xindi
and Romulan Wars.

1178
01:42:15.279 --> 01:42:16.520
And for what?

1179
01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.202
For the Federation
to sit me in a captain's chair

1180
01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:23.404
and break bread with the enemy.

1181
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.887
We change. We have to.

1182
01:42:27.199 --> 01:42:30.408
Or we spend the rest of our lives
fighting the same battles.

1183
01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:07.845
You lost!

1184
01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.966
There's no way
you can make it back there.

1185
01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.131
Give up.

1186
01:43:16.119 --> 01:43:17.804
What, like you did?

1187
01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.122
I read your ship's log,

1188
01:43:22.479 --> 01:43:24.448
Captain James T. Kirk.

1189
01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.246
At least I know what I am.

1190
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.489
I am a soldier.

1191
01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.841
You won the war, Edison.

1192
01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.762
You gave us peace.

1193
01:43:35.079 --> 01:43:36.286
Peace

1194
01:43:37.439 --> 01:43:39.442
is not what I was born into.

1195
01:43:43.159 --> 01:43:44.161
Scotty.

1196
01:43:44.279 --> 01:43:46.408
Captain, he's using
the gravitational slipstream

1197
01:43:46.479 --> 01:43:48.083
to carry him back to the center.

1198
01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:51.600
Nah.

1199
01:44:30.239 --> 01:44:31.729
No! No!

1200
01:44:41.159 --> 01:44:42.729
- What's that?
- The weapon's in the chamber.

1201
01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.484
Captain, we have to stop
the processor now

1202
01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:47.291
or everything breathing
in Yorktown is dead!

1203
01:44:56.199 --> 01:44:58.680
You can't stop it.

1204
01:45:00.359 --> 01:45:01.725
You will die.

1205
01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:04.887
Better to die saving lives

1206
01:45:05.439 --> 01:45:07.568
than to live with taking them.

1207
01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.601
That's what I was born into.

1208
01:45:11.239 --> 01:45:12.240
Scotty!

1209
01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:13.965
Captain,
I think we can redirect it.

1210
01:45:14.039 --> 01:45:15.804
There's a sealed construction hatch

1211
01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:17.564
that will let you vent the weapon
into space.

1212
01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:19.005
Now, we can override
the locks from up here,

1213
01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:20.490
but you will have to activate the hatch.

1214
01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.800
So I just hit a button.

1215
01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.407
It's not a button, sir.
It's a silver lever under a white panel.

1216
01:45:26.079 --> 01:45:28.207
- Got it!
- And there's four of them.

1217
01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:29.841
Once you've primed the hatch,

1218
01:45:30.079 --> 01:45:31.569
you'll have to exit
the chamber immediately.

1219
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.569
If the hatch is open
when the processor cycles

1220
01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.529
and you're in it,
you're gonna get sucked into space.

1221
01:45:36.079 --> 01:45:37.922
What happens if the hatch isn't open?

1222
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.524
You're gonna get sucked into a big fan.

1223
01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.047
With the weapon, and we all die.

1224
01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:45.288
Damn it, Jim, you won't
make it out in time!

1225
01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:55.841
The vent!

1226
01:45:58.359 --> 01:46:00.123
Get out of there, James T.!

1227
01:46:01.039 --> 01:46:03.565
Scotty, the last hatch won't open!

1228
01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:10.680
Scotty!

1229
01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.887
Work fast, Captain, time's running out!

1230
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.086
He's not gonna make it.

1231
01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:46.801
No! No!

1232
01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.081
Manual override engaged.

1233
01:47:22.359 --> 01:47:23.360
Whoo-hoo!

1234
01:47:28.359 --> 01:47:30.567
What would I do without you, Spock?

1235
01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:06.087
For decades
the Federation taught that he was a hero.

1236
01:48:06.399 --> 01:48:08.686
I guess time will judge us all.

1237
01:48:10.439 --> 01:48:12.090
He just got lost.

1238
01:48:12.399 --> 01:48:14.128
You saved this entire base, Kirk.

1239
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.530
Millions of souls. Thank you.

1240
01:48:19.079 --> 01:48:22.003
It wasn't just me. It never is.

1241
01:48:22.399 --> 01:48:26.404
Needless to say, the position
of Vice Admiral is yours.

1242
01:48:27.159 --> 01:48:28.604
No one deserves it more.

1243
01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.443
Vice Admirals don't fly, do they?

1244
01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.082
No. They don't.

1245
01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.521
Well, no offense, ma'am,

1246
01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.444
but where's the fun in that?

1247
01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.921
You didn't even
try to get our time out here reduced?

1248
01:49:50.199 --> 01:49:51.201
Why would I get it reduced?

1249
01:49:51.279 --> 01:49:53.680
Bones, we know our way
through the nebula now.

1250
01:49:54.079 --> 01:49:55.524
Can you imagine what we'll find!

1251
01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:58.001
Alien despots hell-bent on killing us?

1252
01:49:58.079 --> 01:50:00.207
Deadly space-borne
viruses and bacteria?

1253
01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:04.002
Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies
that could wipe us out in an instant!

1254
01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:06.006
It's gonna be so much fun.

1255
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.239
By the way, where are we going?

1256
01:50:09.319 --> 01:50:10.525
I thought we were gonna get a drink.

1257
01:50:11.039 --> 01:50:13.202
I know you told me to keep it
under wraps, but, uh...

1258
01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:15.051
Happy Birthday!

1259
01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:19.489
Mr. Sensitive?

1260
01:50:20.279 --> 01:50:22.043
- There you go, laddie.
- Thanks, Scotty.

1261
01:50:23.439 --> 01:50:26.807
Everybody, raise a glass
to Captain James T. Kirk.

1262
01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.689
- Captain Kirk!
- Thanks, everybody.

1263
01:50:31.039 --> 01:50:33.485
- To the Enterprise.
- To the Enterprise.

1264
01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:34.970
And

1265
01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:37.289
to absent friends.

1266
01:50:38.159 --> 01:50:39.685
- Here's to that.
- Cheers.

1267
01:50:41.199 --> 01:50:43.487
All right,
let's get this party started.

1268
01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:44.640
Whose round is it?

1269
01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.405
Can I get three, uh,
Romulan ales for me?

1270
01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:51.565
I thought you had to
finish your mission report.

1271
01:50:52.239 --> 01:50:53.479
I do.

1272
01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:56.927
But I thought it would be more pleasing
to engage with you socially.

1273
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.286
You old romantic.

1274
01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:11.690
Do you know that scotch
was actually invented

1275
01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:13.603
by a little old lady in Russia?

1276
01:51:14.239 --> 01:51:16.606
- Huh? Not many people know.
- Excuse me.

1277
01:51:18.119 --> 01:51:21.408
Uh, did you drink all those yourself?
I'm impressed.

1278
01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:23.921
Someone said it will take my edge off.

1279
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.203
My edge is still not off.

1280
01:51:27.039 --> 01:51:28.609
All right, well, maybe this will help.

1281
01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:31.761
Captain pulled a few strings.

1282
01:51:32.199 --> 01:51:35.123
That is acceptance
into Starfleet Academy, if you want it.

1283
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.570
They have a lot of rules.
Don't listen to them all.

1284
01:51:39.039 --> 01:51:40.962
Will I have to wear that uniform?

1285
01:51:42.119 --> 01:51:43.451
Afraid so.

1286
01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:46.881
Hey, Keenser.

1287
01:51:47.239 --> 01:51:49.765
Kevin. Still not wearing pants, I see.

1288
01:51:56.279 --> 01:51:58.442
I heard about Ambassador Spock.

1289
01:52:00.119 --> 01:52:03.248
Is that what you wanted
to mention that time in the turbolift?

1290
01:52:06.479 --> 01:52:07.685
More or less.

1291
01:52:10.079 --> 01:52:13.162
I trust your meeting with
Commodore Paris went well.

1292
01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:17.885
More or less.

1293
01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.921
You really want
to head back out there, huh?

1294
01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.844
Space, the final frontier.

1295
01:52:59.039 --> 01:53:01.202
These are
the voyages of the Starship...

1296
01:53:01.279 --> 01:53:04.443
...Enterprise.
Its continuing mission...

1297
01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:06.886
To explore strange new worlds.

1298
01:53:07.039 --> 01:53:08.689
To seek out new life.

1299
01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:10.722
And new civilizations.

1300
01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:14.520
To boldly go
where no one has gone before.
